# uGet - Download Manager

This repo was created for 2 reasons:

1. to point people to the source code of uGet which is hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/urlget/uget2/ci/master/tree/) not here on GitHub. (We started uGet before GitHub existed)
2. this will also allow people to create issues here for the main application of uGet.

We prefer all bugs, feature requests, and questions be made on our [uGet QA system](https://ugetdm.com/qa) but for those that insist on using GitHub for some reason. We're ok with making that an option too, however there may be a longer wait period here as I can only pay attention to so many platforms. :D
